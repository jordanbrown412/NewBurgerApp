HandleBars

Databas: Put, Post, Get

##How Code Works

Upon opening of Application user is prompted to "create" a burger. When burger is created Database is updated with burger info and populated on handlebars page. 

If Devoured button is selected database is updated with devoured value equal to true and burger is moved to devoured table on the handlebars page.
